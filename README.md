# leaflet-challenge

In this project, I utilized Leaflet to render an interactive map that displays up to the minute updated data on earthquakes.  The map markers display the size of the magnitude, and colors the marker based on the depth of the earthquake.  Options added were 3 views, a color-coded legend, and a popup box displaying detailed information.

The primary technologies utilized were HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Leaflet, and utilized an API call to Mapbox.
